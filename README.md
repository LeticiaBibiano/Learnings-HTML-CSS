# Learnings-HTML-CSS
 Just codes that I learned and practiced. Here I learned HTML and CSS.

The first code is "TABLES" which shows how to make a table, with all the details and responsive layout.

The second code is "FORMS" which shows how to make a form, with a complete list of all HTML inputs. For anyone interested to learn.

The third code is "MENU" which shows how to make a menu, with smooth scroll and using FLEX-BOX to center horizontally and vertically DIV's within sessions.
