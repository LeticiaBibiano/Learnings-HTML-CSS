# Learnings-HTML-CSS
 Just codes that I learned and practiced. Here I learned HTML and CSS.

The first code is "how to creat a table" with all the details and responsive layout.

THIS REPOSITORY WAS CREATED FOR MY OWN LERNING AND ALSO TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED IT. ENJOY.

With best wishes, Let√≠cia Bibiano.
