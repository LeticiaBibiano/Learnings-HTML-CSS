# Learnings-HTML-CSS
 Just codes that I learned and practiced. Here I learned HTML and CSS.

The first code is "how to creat a table" with all the details and responsive layout.

The second code is "how to creat forms" and there is a complete list of all HTML inputs. For anyone interested to learn.

THIS REPOSITORY WAS CREATED FOR MY OWN LERNING AND ALSO TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED IT. ENJOY.

With best wishes, Let√≠cia Bibiano.
